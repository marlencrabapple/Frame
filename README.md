# Frame #
Frame is a possibly opinionated take on a barebones (as of now), "best practices" web framework for the Perl programming language.

## Name and Rationale ##
Frame is named for the sentiment that creating yet another web framework for a language with dwindling popularility would not be advisable unless it was a labor of love, not work.
